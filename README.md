## Online demo

Deployed site: https://door.casbin.com/

## Quick Start

Run your own casdoor program in a few minutes:smiley:

### Download

There are two methods, get code via go subcommand `get`:

```shell
go get github.com/casbin/casdoor
```

  or `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoor
```

Finally, change directory:

```bash
cd casdoor/
```

We provide two start up methods for all kinds of users.

### Manual

#### Simple configuration

Edit `conf/app.conf`, modify `dataSourceName` to correct database info, which follows this format:

```bash
username:password@tcp(database_ip:database_port)/
```

#### Run

Casdoor provides two run modes, the difference is binary size and user prompt.

##### Dev Mode

Edit `conf/app.conf`, set `runmode=dev`. Firstly build front-end files:

```bash
cd web/ && yarn && yarn run start
```
*‚ùó A word of caution ‚ùó: Casdoor's front-end is built using yarn. You should use `yarn` instead of `npm`. It has a potential failure during building the files if you use `npm`.*

Then build back-end binary file, change directory to root(Relative to casdoor):

```bash
go run main.go
```

That's it! Try to visit http://127.0.0.1:7001/. :small_airplane:  
**But make sure you always request the backend port 8000 when you are using SDKs.**

##### Production Mode

Edit `conf/app.conf`, set `runmode=prod`. Firstly build front-end files:

```bash
cd web/ && yarn && yarn run build
```

Then build back-end binary file, change directory to root(Relative to casdoor):

```bash
go build main.go && sudo ./main
```

> Notice, you should visit back-end port, default 8000. Now try to visit **http://SERVER_IP:8000/**

### Docker

This method requires [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to be installed first.

#### Simple configuration

Edit `conf/app.conf`, modify `dataSourceName` to the fixed content:

```bash
dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(db:3306)/
```

> If you need to modify `conf/app.conf`, you need to re-run `docker-compose up`.

#### Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That's it! Try to visit http://localhost:8000/. :small_airplane:

### Docker Hub

This method requires [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to be installed first.

```bash
docker pull casbin/casdoor
```

## Detailed documentation

We also provide a complete [document](https://casdoor.org/) as a reference.
